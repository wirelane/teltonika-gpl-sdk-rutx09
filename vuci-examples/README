# Custom Web page and API creation

## Technologies

- WebUI apps are built using Vue 3 Javascript framework.
- Backend API apps are built using Lua 5.1 programming language.

## Building

    1. Copy "vuci-app-example-api" and "vuci-app-example-ui" into "RUTX_R_GPL_00.07.16.1/package/feeds/vuci" directory.

       Directory names can be changed, but API and UI names must match, for example "vuci-app-test-app-api" and "vuci-app-test-app-ui" are valid.

    2. Enter OpenWrt Configuration

        $ make menuconfig

    3. Navigate to "VuCI -> Applications/UI" and select <M> or <*> for "vuci-app-example-ui".

        - If <M> is selected application will not be installed when compiling the firmware and will need to be installed manually.

        - If <*> is selected application will be installed when compiling the firmware.

    4. Build the selected APP

        - Building application for <M> mode:

            $ make package/vuci-app-example-ui/{clean,compile}

        - Building firmware for <*> mode:

            $ make clean
            $ make

    5. After building both the API and UI packages will be available in "RUTX_R_GPL_00.07.16.1/bin/packages/ipq40xx/vuci"

## Manual installation

    1. Copy both API and UI packages from "RUTX_R_GPL_00.07.16.1/bin/packages/ipq40xx/vuci" to the device.

        $ scp "RUTX_R_GPL_00.07.16.1/bin/packages/ipq40xx/vuci/vuci-app-example-api_1_ipq40xx.ipk" "RUTX_R_GPL_00.07.16.1/bin/packages/ipq40xx/vuci/vuci-app-example-ui_1_ipq40xx.ipk" root@192.168.1.1:/tmp

    2. Install using "opkg"

        $ opkg install /tmp/vuci-app-example-api_1_ipq40xx.ipk
        $ opkg install /tmp/vuci-app-example-ui_1_ipq40xx.ipk

## Package Manager package compilation

    1. Modify "RUTX_R_GPL_00.07.16.1/ipk_packages.json" by adding the following lines:

        "vuci-app-example-ui": {
            "name": "example_app",
            "vuci_dep": "vuci-app-example-api"
        }

    2. Enter OpenWrt Configuration:

        $ make menuconfig

    3. Navigate to "VuCI -> Applications/UI" and select <M> for "vuci-app-example-ui".

    4. Build the selected APP:

        $ make package/vuci-app-example-ui/{clean,compile}

    5. Compile Package Manager packages:

        $ make pm

    6. After compilation this package should apprear in in "RUTX_R_GPL_00.07.16.1/bin/packages/<arch_name>/zipped_packages" as "example_app.tar.gz".
